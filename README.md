### 🟦 CPP_03

* **ex00:** Learn basic class design and object management with simple attributes.
* **ex01:** Explore inheritance by extending a class and modifying behavior.
* **ex02:** Deepen inheritance understanding with further specialization.
* **ex03:** Practice multiple inheritance and handling complex class hierarchies.

### 🟦 CPP_04

* **ex00:** Learn basic polymorphism with base and derived classes.
* **ex01:** Implement dynamic memory in classes and test deep copies.
* **ex02:** Work with abstract classes to prevent direct instantiation.
* **ex03:** Apply interfaces and manage objects through abstract types.

### 🟦 CPP_05

* **ex00:** Learn class design with constraints, exceptions, and basic error handling.
* **ex01:** Implement interaction between classes and enforce rules through exceptions.
* **ex02:** Work with abstract base classes and specialized derived forms that perform actions.
* **ex03:** Automate object creation and manage polymorphic objects.

### 🟦 CPP_06

* **ex00:** Work with type conversions and casts.
* **ex01:** Learn serialization by converting pointers to integer representations and back.
* **ex02:** Identify real object types at runtime using polymorphism without `typeid`.

### 🟦 CPP_07

* **ex00:** Learn function templates; implement generic `swap`, `min`, and `max` functions.
* **ex01:** Apply function templates to arrays; implement a generic `iter` function.
* **ex02:** Practice class templates; implement a generic `Array` class with dynamic allocation.

### 🟦 CPP_08

* **ex00:** Learn function templates with containers; implement `easyfind` to search for integers in any container.
* **ex01:** Practice custom container design; implement a `Span` class with range operations.
* **ex02:** Extend STL containers; implement an iterable stack supporting all stack operations plus iterators.

### 🟦 CPP_09

* **ex00:** Use file I/O and associative containers to compute bitcoin values by date from a CSV database.
* **ex01:** Apply stack-based algorithms; implement an RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) calculator using containers.
* **ex02:** Practice advanced sorting algorithms using Ford-Johnson sort on sequences and measure performance.
